The navigation and basic file system commands I had already been familiar with, so they werent very difficult. I did have some trouble with the 'echo' command to add text to the text file as I wasn't sure how to properly use it to get text to redirect, so instead I just used vim. However, especially with the redirection commands we learnt in class, I think the command will be quite usefull once I'm more confident in using it. I also had some trouble with the tar command, as the notes I had didn't have infomation on how to compress to get the '.gz' extension. The 'du' command also had issues where it wouldn't display the space used by the compressed file and only displayed the folders. 
Using the kill command felt the most risky as I didn't know what processes were running (
